## Digital version of the rent-to-own Model.  Divvy Homes increases the accessiblity of homeownership.
* The Company was founded in 2017
* Restrictive mortgage requirements following the Housing Collapse had made it increasingly tough for middle-class Americans to buy a house.  Founders Adena Hefets Alex Klarfeld and Nick Clark recognized the opportunity and set out to provide another way for those who lacked the free cashflow or ability to obtain a mortgage to purchase a home.
* Divvy purchases the home, enters into a three year lease with the consumer, and then provides consumer the option to either purchase the home or walk away at the maturity of the lease contract.
* Fairly new to the scene, Divvy Homes is currently available in sixteen markets including Atlanta, Cleveland, and Dallas
* Founders include: Adena Hefets, Alex Klarfeld, Brian Ma, Nicholas Clark 
* Divvy is a privately held company that has received Series A, B, C, D and some Debt Financing

## Business Activities
What Specific financial problem is the company or project trying to solve?
- It gives potential creditworthy consumers the means to purcahse a home sooner and with less friction costs.

Who is the company's intended customer?  Is there any information about the market size of this set of customers?  What solution does this company offer that their competitors do not or cannot offer?
- The intended customers are middle-class Americans who have either not yet built up the available credit or free cashflow that would allow them to immediately purchase a home.
- 35% of US consumers have FICO Scores lower than 675 and 16% hae a score below 580.  According to ICE Mortgage Technology, the average FICO score for home buyers with FHA loans was 677 for the 6mth period ending in September 2021.  A minimum credit score of 580 along with a 10% down payment are required for a FHA Loan, and that's the low end of the totem pole.  
- Divvy's mkt size is ~17-37mm consumers who have a credit score below 580 or between 580-675 (Assuming a US population size of 329.5mm and an average aged home buyer of 25-45 which makes up 44% of the population with 53% of them listed as married).
- Divvy only requires an application approval process, a 2% downpayment, and proof of two month's rent.  Everything else from taxes and insurance to closing costs is covered by Divvy.  This simplifies the homebuying process for the customer and puts them on the first step towards purchasing a home.

Which technologies are they currently using, and how are they implementing them?
- Credit verification algorithm (?)
- Online applications rather than meeting with a banker
- One stop shop soup to nuts purchasing of the home....Divvy real estate agents will guide the customer through the home buying and negotiation process
- Divvy requests the customer to make both a rent and a "savings" payment each month to build equity
